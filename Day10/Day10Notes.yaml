Notes:

npm install dotenv

Steps to run your data related .env

filename.env
qa.env
prod.env

1, Method :
process.env.envVariable
//dotenv.config({path:"Data/prod.env"})//setting path to read your .env file

2. Method :

const filetoRead = process.env.filename||'qa'//if you don't have a fileName here by deafult it will read your 'qa'

dotenv.config({path:`Data/${filetoRead}.env`})

In the terminal :
$env:filename='prod'-->set the path to read the file

To know which path is set:
$env:filename


3. Method :
Create multiple config file

npx playwright test filename --config=playwright.qa.config.ts

npx playwright test filename --config=playwright.prod.config.ts

package.json :

script{

"testrunqa"="npx playwright test filename --config=playwright.qa.config.ts"
"testrunprod"="npx playwright test filename --config=playwright.prod.config.ts"

}

File Upload

We have 2 methods to check while uploading a file.

1, Check for the type="file" is present in your DOM
2, If you dont fine type="file" we will using waitForEvent('filechooser')
